			<h2>The Difference Between Unicode and UTF-8</h2>
			Unicode is a <b> character set </b>. UTF-8 is <b> encoding </b>.
			<I> Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points) </I>. A = 65, B = 66, C = 67, ....
			<br>
			<u> This list of decimal numbers represent the string "hello": 104 101 108 108 111 </u>
			<br>
			<s>Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored in a computer:</s>
			UTF-8 encoding will store "hello" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100  01101111

						<h2>	The Unicode Consortium </h2>

					The Unicode Consortium develops the Unicode Standard. Their goal is to replace the existing character sets with its standard Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

					The Unicode Standard has become a success and is implemented in HTML, XML, Java, JavaScript, E-mail, ASP, PHP, etc. The Unicode standard is also supported in many operating systems and all modern browsers.

					The Unicode Consortium cooperates with the leading standards development organizations, like ISO, W3C, and ECMA.
					The Unicode Character Sets

					Unicode can be implemented by different character sets. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16:
					Character-set 	Description
					UTF-8 	A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages
					UTF-16 	16-bit Unicode Transformation Format is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode, capable of encoding the entire Unicode repertoire. UTF-16 is used in major operating systems and environments, like Microsoft Windows, Java and .NET.
					<br>
					Tip: The first 128 characters of Unicode (which correspond one-to-one with ASCII) are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, making valid ASCII text valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well.

					HTML 4 supports UTF-8. HTML 5 supports both UTF-8 and UTF-16!
					The HTML5 Standard: Unicode UTF-8

					Because the character sets in ISO-8859 were limited in size, and not compatible in multilingual environments, the Unicode Consortium developed the Unicode Standard.
					<br>
					The Unicode Standard covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

					Unicode enables processing, storage, and transport of text independent of platform and language.

					The default character encoding in HTML-5 is UTF-8.

					If an HTML5 web page uses a different character set than UTF-8, it should be specified in the <meta> tag like:

					<h2>Learn by Examples</h2>

			Examples are better than 1000 words. Examples are often easier to understand than text explanations.

			This tutorial supplements all explanations with clarifying "Try it Yourself" examples.

			JavaScript Examples

			If you try all the examples, you will learn a lot about JavaScript, in a very short time!
			Why Study JavaScript?

			JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

			   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
			<br>
			   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

			   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

			Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
			Did You Know?

			JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
			<br>
			JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
			ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

			You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions.
			Learning Speed

			In this tutorial, the learning speed is your choice.

			Everything is up to you.

			If you are struggling, take a break, or reread the material.

			Always make sure you understand all the "Try-it-Yourself" examples.
